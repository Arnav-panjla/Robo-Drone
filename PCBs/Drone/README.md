## 1. üìù Introduction

This README provides detailed information about the motor driver circuit designed for controlling four propellers of a drone using an ESP32 microcontroller. The motor driver circuit can handle up to 3.3A at maximum load and operates a 3.7V motor in a single direction.

## 2. üõ†Ô∏è Necessity of Creating the Motor Driver

The development of this motor driver circuit is essential for several reasons:

- **High Current Handling**: This motor driver can handle up to 3.3A, which is unmatched by other drivers in the market within this price range, making it an economical yet powerful solution for drone applications.

- **Optimization for Drones**: The design is fully optimized for drone operations, ensuring efficient control of the motors under varying loads and conditions.



- **Signal Amplification**:

 The 3.3V output from the ESP32 was insufficient to drive the MOSFETs directly. To address this, we incorporated an operational amplifier (op-amp) with a non-inverting gain of 1.5. This setup amplifies the 3.3V signal to approximately 5V, effectively driving the MOSFETs and consequently powering the drone motors.
