## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Overview

### Motor Driver Circuit: [Motor Driver Schematics PDF](./MotorDriverSchematics.PDF)

The motor driver circuit is designed to interface with the ESP32 and control the speed and operation of a 3.7V motor. The circuit utilizes MOSFETs or a dedicated motor driver IC to manage the power to the motor efficiently.

- **Voltage**: 3.7V and 7.4 for powering opAMPs
- **Current**: Up to 3.3A

### Complete Circuit with ESP32

The complete circuit integrates the ESP32 microcontroller, which acts as the brain of the drone, controlling the four motor driver circuits. Each motor driver is controlled by a PWM signal from the ESP32.
