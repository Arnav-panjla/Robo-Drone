## Introduction üåü

The drone is designed to be a versatile platform for exploring robotics, remote control, and sensor integration. At its core, the drone utilizes an ESP32-C3 module for communication and control, enabling advanced features such as PID control and integration with a BMX160 sensor for enhanced stability and performance.

## Components üõ†Ô∏è

- **Chassis**: 3D-printed design for a lightweight and durable structure.
- **Microcontroller**: Xiao ESP32-C3 for receiving signals and controlling motors.
- **Motor Drivers**: Custom-built motor drivers using operational amplifiers (op-amps) and N-channel MOSFETs.
- **Remote Controller**: Built with an ESP32, joystick module, and switches for intuitive control.
- **Sensors**: PID controller and BMX160 sensor for improved stability and performance.

## Design and Architecture üñ•Ô∏è

- **Communication**: The drone and remote controller communicate via Wi-Fi, utilizing the ESP32‚Äôs capabilities.
- **Motor Control**: PWM signals generated by the ESP32 are amplified by op-amps and used to drive the motors through N-channel MOSFETs.
- **Control Logic**: Implemented PID control for precise maneuvering and stability.
- **posotion calibration**: Done by BMX160 measurment and subsequently using kalman filter.

## Functionality ‚úàÔ∏è

- **Remote Control**: Control the drone using a joystick and switches on the remote controller.
- **Stability and Responsiveness**: Utilizes PID control and BMX160 sensor feedback filtered thruogh kalman filter to maintain stable flight.
- **Customizability**: Fully customizable components for future modifications and enhancements.

## Usage üì°

1. Power on the drone and remote controller.
2. Connect the remote controller to the drone's Wi-Fi network.
3. Use the joystick remote to control the drone's movements.
